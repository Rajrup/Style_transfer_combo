# Style_transfer_combo

Pytorch based implementations of style transfer algorithms . 

## Completed:
- Implementation of the basic algorithm mentioned in Leon Gatys's paper https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf

- GPU support enabled .
 
## TODO:

- Enabling optimization run on CPU.. Device selection capability.
- Training the model with coco images
- Automatic weight selection
- Photorealistic image generation
